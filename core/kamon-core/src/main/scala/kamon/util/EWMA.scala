/**
  * Exponentially Weighted Moving Average implementation with thread safety guarantees. Users of this class should
  * periodically record values on the structure and are free to read the current average at any time. This
  * implementation does not make any assumptions regarding the time between recordings and leaves the responsibility of
  * deciding when to record values to the user.
  *
  * The only required parameter is the weighting factor, which effectively determines how quickly the moving average
  * will adapt to new data. The weighting factor is a number between 0 and 1 (exclusive). The closer the weighting
  * factor is to 0, the more influence new values will have over the moving average and thus the moving average is more
  * responsive; conversely, if the weighting factor is closer to 1, the moving average will take more iterations to
  * adapt to new data.
