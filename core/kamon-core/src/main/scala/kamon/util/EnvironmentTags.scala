  *   - "host", with the host name from the Environment
  *   - "instance", with the instance name from the Environment
  *   - One additional pair for each Environment tag, unless exclusions are provided when transforming.
  *
  * Most uses of this class are expected to happen in reporter modules, where the Environment information should usually
  * be exposed along with the metrics and spans.
