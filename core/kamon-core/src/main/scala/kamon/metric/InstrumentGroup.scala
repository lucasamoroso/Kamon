/**
  * Utility class for handling groups of instruments that should be created and removed together. This becomes specially
  * handy when using several instruments to track different aspects of the same component. For example, when tracking
  * metrics on a thread pool you will want to request several instruments to track different aspects: the pool size, the
  * number of submitted tasks, the queue size and so on, and all of those instruments should share common tags that are
  * specific to the instrumented thread pool; additionally, once said thread pool is shutdown, all of those instruments
  * should be removed together. This class makes it simpler to keep track of all of those related instruments and remove
  * them together when necessary.
